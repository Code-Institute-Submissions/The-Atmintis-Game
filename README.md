## Design 

### Colour and font
Colour and font were taken into account in order to make the interface eye catching for children, but also incorporated best practices in terms of accessibility, in order to cater for users of all learning abilities. 
### Images
I designed all the images myself using a free image website: https://www.shutterstock.com/, I then copied and designed these on a word doc, converting to PNG files. I would in future source this out or take a design course. 
The images had to be friendly and fun.
### Sound
I downloaded my sounds from: https://www.zapsplat.com/. I selected the sound for children, helping the game to be fun adnd happy

### Click to Start

Once the user feels confident, the can start the game buy clicking on the box "click to start" This will then start a funny countdown along with a timer and turn count.

### Timer - Count Down 

I have included a countdown for the end user so they can countify their learning, they have 110 seconds to match all the English numbers with their corresponding Lithuanian number. This feature allows the end user to see how long it took and also encourage them to come back and beat the time they set. If the time reaches 0 seconds, a game over message will appear along with a message "click to start again".

* Child - I want to learn Lithuanian using a fun platform where i can see improvments.
* Parent -  It is hard to get my child to concentrate and learn Lithuanian, I need a platform that is fun while learning.


### Turn - counter

I have also included a turn counter, like the timer but intead increasing as the user clicks on a card. this is another way for the user to test themselves, it also gives them a score to beat.

### Gameboard

The gameboard has 20 cards. Ten times 2 sets, with 1 to 10 for each language (English and Lithuanian). When the game starts the cards are facedown and shuffled. 

The user clicks on a card, this will turn the card over and the image will shake while you are hovering, turning the card is accompanied with a turning sound, the user then has select another card, the goal here is to find the opposite language number. If the cards match the cards stay put and the user will get a matched sound. If the cards do not match they turn back over for the user to start searching again.

Every click will increase the turn counter, while the clock is ticking down. If the user completes the game by matching all the cards on the board before the time runs out, they are presented wiuth a winner message and the option to click and try again.

### Contact Developer

On this page you have a section for any parent that wishes to exspand the game or ask for it in another language. This uses EmailJS 

**Related user story addressed:**

* Parent - I would like other learning subjects not just counting to ten.


### Features Left to Implement

* Counting is the first of this gameâ€™s features. Further features to implement include learning letters of the alphabet, colours, and animals. 
* The learning section will be a signle page with picture and animations against the numbers, once the user is ready then will then be passed to 'The Antmintis Game'
* I have uploaded single numbers to the gamne that are currently hidden, the plan here is to have them grow and dance once the user hits a match, unfortunatly the images are poor and i would rather have a designer develop them. For now i used the images and the scource as the identifier for the match.
* I want to add a click function to the numbers under the learn section. On Click you will have a voice speaking the number in Lithuanian, this will help the end user pronounce the words correctly.

### NOTE - During this project I had to work from the hospital (first baby arrival) for the first three days, I created the header/footer/index.html and team.html pages. I was adding and committing every change while creating these pages. Once I got home, it looked like the commits did not save, in fact most the work did not. This left me stressed and worried. I created the pages from scratch again, but did not commit as much as I first did.
