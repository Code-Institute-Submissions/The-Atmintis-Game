[View the live project here](https://leefarmer83.github.io/The-Atmintis-Game/)

This is a website designed to teach children between the ages of 3 - 5 years of age how to count to ten in Lithuanian or English on a desktop computer. 

The game features cards on a board that users need to match the English number to the correct, corresponding Lithuanian number. There is a timer and a turn count, this can be used to see how the end user is improving, the aim here is to have highest number of seconds with the least number of turns.

## Game Rules
The Atmintis Game is a single player game. The player has to look at the buttons at the top of the screen, and learn the numbers that are not in their home language. The aim of the game is to learn through matching the cards on the game board. Once players have reviewed the numbers at the top of the screen, they start the game by turning a card to see the number on the back. Depending on the card turned, the number will be in either Lithuanian or English. Players then need to turn other cards, and find the match with their selected, corresponding card. Once the game has started, the timer countdown, and the turn indicator lets the player know how many cards they have turned over in their search for the corresponding number of a selected card. The timer, and the turn counter can be used to measure how quickly the player is learning. The less time and turns taken, the quicker the player has memorised and learnt the numbers. These functions also foster a fun, competitive element against parents, siblings or other players.

## Design 

### Colour and font
Colour and font were taken into account in order to make the interface eye catching for children, but also incorporated best practices in terms of accessibility, in order to cater for users of all learning abilities. 
### Images
I designed all the images myself using a free image website: https://www.shutterstock.com/, I then copied and designed these on a word doc, converting to PNG files. I would in future source this out or take a design course. 
The images had to be friendly and fun.
### Sound
I downloaded my sounds from: https://www.zapsplat.com/. I selected the sound for children, helping the game to be fun and happy.

## Learn Section

This sections has Lithuanian numbers 1 t 10 on buttons, when you hover over the button you will see the English version of this number.

**Related user story addressed:**

### Click to Start

Once the user feels confident, the can start the game buy clicking on the box "click to start" This will then start a funny countdown along with a timer and turn count.

### Timer - Count Down 

I have included a countdown for the end user so they can countify their learning, they have 110 seconds to match all the English numbers with their corresponding Lithuanian number. This feature allows the end user to see how long it took and also encourage them to come back and beat the time they set. If the time reaches 0 seconds, a game over message will appear along with a message "click to start again".

* Child - I want to learn Lithuanian using a fun platform where i can see improvements.
* Parent -  It is hard to get my child to concentrate and learn Lithuanian, I need a platform that is fun while learning.


### Turn - counter

I have also included a turn counter, like the timer but intead increasing as the user clicks on a card. this is another way for the user to test themselves, it also gives them a score to beat.

### Gameboard

The gameboard has 20 cards. Ten times 2 sets, with 1 to 10 for each language (English and Lithuanian). When the game starts the cards are facedown and shuffled. 

The user clicks on a card, this will turn the card over and the image will shake while you are hovering, turning the card is accompanied with a turning sound, the user then has select another card, the goal here is to find the opposite language number. If the cards match the cards stay put and the user will get a matched sound. If the cards do not match they turn back over for the user to start searching again.

Every click will increase the turn counter, while the clock is ticking down. If the user completes the game by matching all the cards on the board before the time runs out, they are presented with a winner message and the option to click and try again.

### Contact Developer

On this page you have a section for any parent that wishes to expand the game or ask for it in another language. This uses EmailJS.

**Related user story addressed:**

* Parent - I would like other learning subjects not just counting to ten.


### Features Left to Implement

* Counting is the first of this game’s features. Further features to implement include learning letters of the alphabet, colours, animals and languages. 
* The learning section will be a single  page with picture and animations against the numbers, once the user is ready then will then be passed to 'The Antmintis Game'
* I have uploaded single number images to the game that are currently hidden, the plan here is to have them grow and dance once the user hits a match, unfortunately the images are poor and I would rather have a designer develop them. For now I used the images and the scsource ource as the identifier for the match.
* I want to add a click function to the numbers under the learn section. On Click you will have a voice speaking the number in Lithuanian, this will help the end user pronounce the words correctly.
* pop up message that states email has been sent on the developer contact page.
* To look at away to make the game mobile friendly, intended use is desktop only due to the need of a large screen.

#### Click to Start Functionality
 1. When opening a new browser, check to see if Click to Start  message appears. Message only disappears when the user clicks over the transparent layer area. This is important because the user may click around the vocabulary learning objects, and we don’t want to start the game at this point. 
 2. Clicking within the transparent layer area should start the game, and the Click to Start message and transparent layer disappear (see timer test). 
 3. Click to Start message size also increases when a user opens a new browser as planned. 
 4. Changes made - animation of Click to Start message increased time to 1.5 seconds for clearer visibility. 
 
#### Learning Buttons
 1. When hovering over each pop-over button, the pop-over messages with the English number should appear at the top, in front of all text. If the user scrolls down, and there is limited space, the pop-over message should show below the button instead. The learning buttons grey out as the pop-over message appears above or below. Scroll down on the page so there is no longer space for the pop-over message to appear at the top, pop-over messages appear below as intended. 
 2. Changes made - pop-over font does not match game board font, to reinforce the difference in the numbers. 
 
#### Turns Function
 1. Enable game by clicking Click to Start function. Click on every card to ensure the turn number starts from zero and increases on every turn of a card. Card selection works as intended. 
 2. By continuously clicking on one card, the turn does not increase. This is important should the user accidentally click on the card twice. 
 3. Once the game becomes idle from the Game Over or Winner message, the Turns counter freezes, showing the user how many turns they have taken. 
 
#### Time Function
  1. When enabling game by clicking Click to Start function, timer starts from 110 seconds and decreases down to zero (Game Over message function)
  2. Once the game becomes disabled from Game Over or Winner messages, Timer freezes, showing the user how long it took them to complete the game, or zero for game over. 
 
#### Game Over Message Function
  1. Once timer hits zero, this enables the Game Over message function, and the transparent layer area to reappear over the cards. Tested this by allowing the timer to reach zero, this works as intended with the end of the game message displayed. 
  2. By clicking Click to Try Again, the game restarts and the timer has reset to the original setting of 110 seconds. 
 
#### Card Function 
  1. When the game starts, all the cards are face down on the game board showing the Learn image on the back. 
  2. When hovering over the back image of cards, Learn images shake on the back of the card as intended. 
  3. When clicking on a card, the card flips over to show the front of the card. 
  4. Turn the card by clicking on the card. When flipping the card, the user can only turn two cards at one time. Once a user has turned two cards, in this phase, the board does not allow the user to click on any other cards. 
  5. When hovering over the front image of cards, the Character images shake on the front of the card as intended. 
  6. When a card is flipped, it remains static until the second card is selected. 
  7. Paired cards - once cards are paired, they remain face up. 
  8. Once all the cards are turned and matched correctly, the winner message will pop up. 

Functionality has been tested on every card on the game board. 
 
####  Winner Function
  1. Once all cards are matched correctly, Winner message appears and Click to Start functionality is enabled. By clicking on Click to Start, the game begins again.
 
#### Sound Functions
  1. Countdown sound starts once the user clicks Click to Start. 
  2. Countdown sound is on a loop. This works until it is called to stop. 
  3. Countdown sound stops (pause) once the user either wins, or gets the Game Over message. 
  4. Countdown sound restarts once the user clicks Try Again. 
  5. Countdown volume tested, acknowledging the user may be in an environment with competing sounds. Countdown volume doesn’t compete with other sound functions. 
  6. Card turn sounds works on every card once the card has been turned. 
  7. Card match sound works on every card once card has been matched. 
  8. Winner sound is activated once the user completes the board with matches, and accompanies the Winner Message. 
  9. Game over sound is activated once the timer reaches zero, and is accompanied by the Game Over message. 

#### Social Media Functions
  1. Clicked on every social media function. This directs the user to correct social media platforms for each icon displayed.
